So for my english assignemnts the
the modules contains a weekly calendar module
and this post actually contain the assignemnts I need to 
complete so in reality the thing I need to be able to do eaily
for the classes is extract data from each of the section in 
the canvas pages
so I should figure out a way to easily do that in the front end
maybe by having a docs area for the front end
with tips for JSON pocessing for canvas
what I can is a way to get certain info
for example
the best thing for me to do would be to be able to 
spit out the modules
and the be able to select a certain module and spit out the things in that module
and then spit out the relevant page info form that module
so I think creating some classes that would do the underground logic for me would be helpful
so that I can apply the methodoloy for all future classes where I need to extract certain data,
and I need to update this data constantyl
I don't mind runnign the program in my computer
in fact I should run most of the programs inside docker containers
that I push to the cloud

I also have a lot of readings for my classes, I would
like to be able to access those readings from my own website
and that's just because a lot of times the readings are just hard to 
find and this make it really annoying

also I can't full screen withouth dowloading

I should automatically fetch the text file
then I should turn it into a string, then send a promtp
to gtp3 to summarize the text into a single paragraph,
and then I should be show a summary of that text 
for the read
