I need to create a chatgpt like interface for gpt3 so that I can still use it after chatgpt cost more money

I also need to be able to prompt it for many things

So the program should be able to take any pdf link from any of the canvas modules
turn it into a string, and sumarize it

Then I should be able to have a thing where I prompt chat-gpt with a question, so that I 
can prompt gpt3 with the questions, plus all the summaries from all the different readings, and it should be able to generate a 
response.

Then I should be able to expand this text.

So in conclusion, I should be able to choose the pdf that the program will read, I will do this logic in the background
I will then generate a response, and then I will have the option to expand selected text.



Next steps for this projects:

    --Create a classes file that can process useful data from any canvas course
    --it should have useful function that allow me to fetch different kinds of data from canvas
    --so really what it should be is abstraction layer for the api, that is accesed thru classes
    --the class logic should just clean up the data nicely, I also wnat the data to be real time
    --so the classes should not store data that changes in permanent variables, instead, things like
    --id, name of class, permanent things can be variables, and then things like grades, 
    --assignment should all be method calls to the backend api.
    --I should definetly make a database and not worry about having the right docker file in the right place since
    -- I am going to need to make and app and improve it along the way anyways, so in conclusion
So actual steps:
    -begin creating a canvas class logic
    -the classes should help with data retrieval and contain multiple subclasses
    -every method should contain subclasses related to the data structure
