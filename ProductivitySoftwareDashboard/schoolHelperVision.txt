A front end dashboard that helps me with school, what are the main function that this app needs to do.

*1) Needs to display grade data for each class.
*2) Needs to display the upcoming assignment and quizes/tests, and their grade value percentage.
*3) If classes don't use canvas or other it should still be able to remind me of the work needed by me. 
*4) It should have a calendar system, it can do this in the background but a dashboard similar to canvas might work,
but should be able to aggregate data from different sources. Or pre input data to be reminded later.

I'm gonna go thru each course this semester, and list the way assignmnets are listed

CSC 20:
    might just be due dates, weird they don't use modules





I'm thinking I should just pull data from due date, and from 
assignemnts info, then add on data from other website thru simple scraping
then also add conditions for classes, and for discussion post, like an early notifications

I would also like assignments to auto complete on their own, so 
for example I would like gpt3 to complete discussion post for me.
I prompt it with the fact, and then I being and end the post. 


I fucked up and erase my requirements thinking process.
I left of by simplifying.
I'm gonna write a simple app with just html
no css 
I will take the the canvas api check for both assignemtns and grades, and then display both grades at the top, and the a list
of assignemnts, the type of assignemt the class they are a part of, the grade percent value.
Only the assignemnts due in the next 2 weeks.
